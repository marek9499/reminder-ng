## About app
For a long time I wanted to refactor the old app called 'todoapp v2' from vanilla-js to angular technology due to the fact that I want to develop myself in this technology, so that this is why this repository was created. Like the previous app, this one was also written as part of my learning and further development. After working hours, I like to sit down and face the next challenges, of course as a passion and if time allows me. There is angular on the frontend, and as part of the backend I put a reliable `json-server`, which fulfills its task perfectly.

```
└─app
  |  directives
  |  enums
  |  content
  |  models
  |  components
  |  services
  |
  └──assets
       fonts
```

## Running
We need two separate terminals:
    
    npm run start

    json-server tasks.json
